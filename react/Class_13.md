1. why we need test case?
--> when we build large applicaion so project has lot of compoenet and we create one more compoenent sothis compoenet may eefect other compoeoent so test case encure that it doesnot effect exting compoenet and code flow this is main reason of testing and we can also some reaso like code performance , scalibility , maintainbility.

2. different type of testing?
--> manual testing
--> automation testing(it immutated the user and check entire project )
        Selium testing (it just simili of manual testing but it convert to the code)
--> Unit testing
        check the small unit of the code
--> integration testing
        it check the association between the compoenent

3. what is jest?
--> jest is a powerful javascript framework which is used for testing js code.

4. react testing libary used the jest inside it.

5. first we check js code testng?
--> 


<!-- how to set testing envoirment -->
* install the react testing libary
* instal jest
* configure the jest
* install jest-environment-jsdom
* install the babel configuration
* for testing the code run command npm run test
